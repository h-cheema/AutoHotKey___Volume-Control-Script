# AutoHotKey Volume Control Script

This script is a modified version of CinnTech's volume .ahk script. [CinnTech's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5c-tua8oh8QUlmXls9AjvQ)  
I've made a few changes to the formatting and allowed microphone muting. I also wanted to add an overview of how to use it.

## Installation


## Why use this script?
* This script saved me a lot of time and effort whenever I had to change my volume, switch between speakers and headphones, or mute my microphone, headphones or speakers. I wanted to share this with others so they could benefit from it too.


## How to use this script
* Winkey + Scroll mouse wheel up = increase volume
* Winkey + Scroll mouse wheel down = decrease volume
* Winkey + Pressing mouse wheel = mute speakers
* Winkey + z = Mute microphone


## How I use this script:
* I have a USB sound card (plugged into the rear of my computer) for my desktop speakers, and I use the built in headphone jack in the front of my computer for my headphones and microphone. Whenever I wanted to switch between headphones and speakers, I had to either unplug my headphones from the jack, or change the device from the windows task bar speaker icon. This script turned all of that process into a single click.
